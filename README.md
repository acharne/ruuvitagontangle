# RuuviTag on Tangle

This little project contains the code described in the blog post 
[RuuviTag auf dem Tangle - IoT & IOTA](https://blog.codecentric.de/2018/02/ruuvitag-tangle-iot-iota/).

Sadly we didn't track our steps with a source control system so I recreated 
important stages using the local history function of my editor. I also used
the opportunity to clean up some areas in the code.

We ran our test on a MacBook Pro 2015 with macOS 10.13.3 and node v8.9.0.
